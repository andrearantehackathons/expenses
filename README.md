Submission for 2022 Pyrahacks 

## Description

This is a simple react app that allows a user to track their money. They can add money by inputting a positive ammount via the "add activity" button or they can spend money by inputting a negative ammount. Additionally they can add a description to each transaction to see where money is going/coming from. The main advantage of this app is that it will actually decline transactions that are either 

- 1) over the budget (one time transaction limit)
- 2) there is not enough money remaining to make
-
